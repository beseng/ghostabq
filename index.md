## Welcome to Ghost Stories ABQ...

This is a choose your own adventure game currently in development. It focuses on telling the sordid, ghostly tales of famous buildings in Albuquerque through player choice. Its goal is to envelop the player so that they truly feel the dread of a traditional Southwestern ghost story.

## Story

You find yourself stuck in one of Albuquerque's many haunted buildings, with no choice but to make yourself cozy for a while. The activity there might prevent that from happening, though... will you make peace with the paranormal, or find yourself haunted?
